# Kelly Olden Group

Technology and development has taken something as simple as a case with foam, and re-created it into something innovative, exciting and new.

Kelly Olden Group LLC co-founded Protex Solutions LLC, because of both the immediate and long term benefits of such a new and unique product line. Together with Kell-Strom, our distributor, we are able to bring these products directly to Kell-Stromâ€™s aviation and aerospace clients, many of whom have annual revenues in the tens of billions. Kelly Olden group LLC are a supplier with great products that Kell-Strom clients need and want. Although these are some of the largest corporations in the world, who have been buying tools, cases and storage containers since their earliest days, many of their representatives have reported that they have never seen anything that matches the quality and precision fitment of our foam. Kell-Strom has already presented the Kelly Olden Group products at a number of aviation trade shows and the consensus is in: they want it!
