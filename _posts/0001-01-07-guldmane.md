Spike-mat for horses.

The Guldmane blanket is unique in it´s field, and has ambassadors that use the blanket in the absolute elite of the sport.

It is a blanket that has two factors of success.

The Roses - The small round roses feels like nails against the skin. They are constructed in a manner so that they are flexible and adjust depending on the horses’ movement. The roses help stimulate the horse which increases the blood circulation. It has a relaxing effect and yields quicker recovery.

Neoprene - The blanket consists of two parts, the inner blanket where the roses are attached, and the outer blanket made of neoprene. This material, neoprene, has a phenomenal ability to stretch and store heat. The effectiveness of the roses comes from the constant pressure caused by the stretched neoprene. This has been professionally tested to secure maximal effectiveness. Without the nail-acting roses, the outer neoprene blanket looses its full effect.
