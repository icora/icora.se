# Project title goes here

Following the success of our installation for Puma by Hussein Chalayan in Selfridges, we were asked to create a one day international press event in London to launch the FW11 collection.

The event was staged in an underground gallery space in central London. The collection was presented on 14 mannequins standing on triangular mirrored stages lit from aboe the skylights. Two metre high transparent acrylic panels created a flow around the space.

A separate curtained off area was home to a sneak preview of the SS12 collection. Apparel and accesories were suspended by invisible a invisible fishing line above a shallow pool of water which reflected the collection like a black mirror.

A video slidehsow to accompany the collection was presented by Hussein Chalayan on a three metre wide, floeating, back projection screen watched by an audience sitting on illuminated cube stools.
